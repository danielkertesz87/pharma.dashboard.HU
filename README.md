# 2022 Pharmaceutical Data Dashboard for Hungary

## Overview
This PowerBI dashboard provides an insightful analysis of the 2022 Pharmaceutical Data for Hungary, organized by ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) classification. It leverages data from the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary, focusing on drug sales and categorization, enhanced with ATC grouping for a detailed pharmaceutical landscape overview.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from a monthly updated database by the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary, available [here](https://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/szakmai_oldalak/publikus_forgalmi_adatok/gyogyszer_forgalmi_adatok). The original database includes drug ATC codes but lacks ATC grouping, which has been manually compiled for this project, covering the first and second levels of the ATC hierarchy along with a county-wise geographical breakdown for enhanced analysis.

## Dashboard Features
- **Main Page**: Showcases comprehensive data visualization with ATC Main and Sub-group filters, substance of drugs, and county-based filtering through a custom Shape Map visual.
- **Tooltips & Drillthrough**: Enhanced interactivity with tooltips showing key performance indicators (KPIs) and a drillthrough feature for detailed drug information.
- **Comparison**: Facilitates year-on-year comparison (2021 vs. 2022) to analyze trends.
- **Custom Formatting**: Incorporates custom visual enhancements for better data representation and comparison.

## How to Use
1. **Filtering Data**: Use the ATC Main and Sub-group filters, or the substance filter for specific insights.
2. **Navigating the Dashboard**: Hover over the map for county KPIs or use the table visual in the bottom right for detailed drillthrough pages on medicines.
3. **Switching Metrics**: Toggle between Revenue and Revenue per Capita data using the bookmarks feature for dynamic visualizations.
